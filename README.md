# Structure of the project

There are **two** `package.json` files:  

#### 1. For development
Sits on path: `electron-boilerplate/package.json`. Here you declare dependencies for your development environment and build scripts. **This file is not distributed with real application!**

Also here you declare the version of Electron runtime you want to use:
```json
"devDependencies": {
  "electron-prebuilt": "^0.24.0"
}
```

#### 2. For your application
Sits on path: `electron-boilerplate/app/package.json`. This is **real** manifest of your application. Declare your app dependencies here.

### Project's folders

- `app` - code of your application goes here.
- `config` - place for you to declare environment specific stuff.
- `build` - in this folder lands built, runnable application.
- `releases` - ready for distribution installers will land here.
- `resources` - resources for particular operating system.
- `tasks` - build and development environment scripts.
